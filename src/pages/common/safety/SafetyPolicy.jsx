            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Making sure Tinder is a safe and positive place of use is very important. As the world's most popular app
              for meeting new people, we take pride in connecting millions of people every day. While a relatively small
              percentage of these matches have led to users being subject to criminal activity, we firmly believe any
              incident of misconduct or criminal behavior is one too many.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              We are continuously improving new systems, processes, and technologies to enhance and reduce our safety

              our community-based home. Whether you're in Santa Monica, SÃ£o Paulo or Seoul - our goal remains the same: a
              safe and positive experience for users on our platform.

              We know the issue of fraud very seriously at Tinder. We have a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior
              of any kind. We have a dedicated fraud team that utilizes a network of industry-leading technology that
              scans for fraud and reviews each and every member profile for red flag language, and conducts manual reviews
              of suspicious profiles, activity, and user-generated reports. Ultimately, no one, whether they met on Tinder
              or any Internet service, should send money to someone they haven't met in person. In addition, users should
              never share personal or financial information with someone online, particularly if they request it.

              Our users' privacy is a top priority at Tinder, and we work diligently to ensure that we go above and beyond
              applicable privacy laws and industry standards. We have implemented multiple layers of security to protect
              our users' personal information, including their photos, messages, and more. We also employ encryption to
              protect our users' communications and other data. When it comes to Tinder, users' data, and information, we

              advertisers advertising to monetize or grow our business. In fact, in 2018, less than that percent of all
